## Introduction

GitHub is a wonderful place. It is a social network that is not like any other. When you build your projects here together with other people, you feel like anything is possible. But unlike other networks where you have a direct communication channel with your fans or followers, here, you are very limited. Our mission is to change that.

We've built this small project with the hope of improving our lives as developers. We believe we can achieve our mission by creating tools that allow opening up a new communication channel with the fans and creating a lifeline between you as the author of your product and your fans, people who starred, watched, and contributed to your project.

This project's only purpose is to be an informational guide, a small community building block, a stepping stone, if you will.

## How it works

When you run it, it will scan your project and will try its best to return you a list of fans of your project and a way for you to connect with them. The speed of execution depends on the size of your project and amount of fans it has.

This list will be in JSON and/or CSV format, depending on the settings you've choosen.

<sup>**Note:** *Any information generated by this software package has only informational purposes. It must not be used for any other activities that might be considered unethical, including unsolicited communication attempts and/or spam.*</sup>

## Quick Start

### Access Token
First of all, you need to create a [GitHub Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens), with all permissions for repositories and users.

### Download
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:faqtly/whois.git
```

Install all requirements:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment
Now you need to set up the application configuration, specify the repository and your GitHub Access Token. You can either create your own `.env` file or use `.env.example`.

*don't forget to remove .example :)

Environment example:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_exampleToken1234567890
GITHUB_REPO=faqtly/whois
```

All done! Now you can launch the app!
```sh
python main.py
```

### Examples:
After that an output folder will be generated, which will contain files with data obtained from your repository.

```sh
\output
    \repo
        repo_users.json # List of all users(URLs)
        repo.json       # End result
        repo.csv        # End result
```

JSON example:
```json
{
    "user123": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com",
        "website": "www.johndoe.com",
        "location": null,
        "company": null
    },
    "janesmth": {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "janesmith@example.com",
        "website": null,
        "location": "Los Angeles, USA",
        "company": "XYZ Corporation"
    }
}
```
